<h5>Via Online Booking (recommended)</h5>

<p>Of course, this is the recommended option! Why else do you use our platform if you still had to do everything manually? But there is still some consequences where the second option can be the better option.</p>

<p>If you navigate through the main navigation menu on the top of the page, you can see the <span class="nav_link_text">Vendors</span> and 
	<span class="nav_link_text">Packages</span> link. From either one, you can do your booking.</p>

<p>From the <span class="nav_link_text">Vendors</span> link, you will be brought to view all of registered vendors and companies. Just choose which vendors you feel like the best and view them. From the Company View Page, you will see another navigation menu on the page. Select the <span class="nav_link_text">Packages</span> tab and choose their package</p>

<p>The advantage of viewing the package from the company view is that, you can select from which the highest rating and reviewed company if you are a newbie and doesn't know which is the best planner. As you can navigate to the <span class="nav_link_text">Review</span> section and decide based on people's opinion on this company.</p>

<p>Meanwhile if you directly jump to the <span class="nav_link_text">Packages</span> tab from the menu on the top of the page, you can select the best package available from any company. Click or select package of your choice, fill in the form, and book.</p>

<p>Please do remember, after you complete submitting your booking form, you will need to wait for the company to accept your booking before you can navigate to the <span class="nav_link_text">Dashboard</span> and organize everything there. Before that, if you jump to your <span class="nav_link_text">Dashboard</span>, you will just see your booking information. It is good to always login and check your booking status, but we will take responsibility to inform you through your registered email address once your booking is accepted by the company.</p>

<h6>What to do if my booking is rejected?</h6>

<p>There are cases where people playing around and do booking just for fun. These will results to dificulties for the companies and vendors by filling up their work bucket with fake deals. Therefore, this is our initiatives to avoid that issue. So, if your booking is been rejected without accepting any information from the company, this might be because they cannot accept it anymore due to their full work bucket or other unavoided circumstances.</p>

<p>Don't worry, you can browse for other packages and do new booking once you clear your booking cart.</p>
